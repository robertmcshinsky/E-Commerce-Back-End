# E - Commerce Back End
## Description
> 🧭This project is to show a small demonstration as to how we are able to use back end database structuring with SQL in order to create a fully functioning application that structures products with different categories and tags. This project uses express, mysql, and sequelize to create a functioning backend for any e-commerce site. Seeing as this application uses just the backend, you will need a program like Insomnia in order to view and test all the routes.
